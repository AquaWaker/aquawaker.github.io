        <p class="textbox">
            Over the summer I had the amazing opportunity to work with Tulip Retail, specifically with their web development 
            team that worked on well.ca. I worked on various tasks that involved both the frontend and backend of the website. 
            Specifically tasks that added accessibility features, creating new pages for easy access to specific information 
            and troubleshooting issues that arise with new code and developing solutions to fix said issues. Tulip is also 
            known for more besides their ecommerce, including clienteling and now point of sale.

        <h1 id="goals" class="body-header">Learning Goals</h1>

        <h3 class="small-header">Critical & Creative Thinking - Inquiry & Analysis</h3>

        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Goal:</strong> 
            My first goal for the winter co-op term is to continue growing my ability to come up with quick solutions to 
            challenges through research, and mentorship with others at Tulip.
        </p>
        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Action Plan:</strong> 
            Through working on different bugs and features, I will challenge myself to learn how to better research different 
            solutions to the various problems I encounter. I want to also challenge myself to learn how to better ask clear 
            questions when I get stuck on tasks.
        </p>
        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Measure of Success:</strong> 
            It will be hard to gauge, but I feel I will see success if I find researching for solutions becoming easier and 
            quicker, if I sometimes do not even need to search for answers, and if I get into good discussions with my peers 
            at Tulip about solving issues around tasks.
        </p>
        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Reflection:</strong> 
            This semester I spent a lot of time both doing tasks that included code that I was familiar with, as well as plenty 
            of tasks that challenged me in my overall understanding of web development. I found that I am becoming much quicker 
            at coming up with solutions to challenges including SQL tables, database information, and frontend development. 
            However I still have room to grow when it comes to PHP. I saw and learned a lot about different topics such as APIs, 
            UIs and migrations, where I found myself having to take my time and ask for directions for when I did not completely 
            understand how the code worked. I am overall happy with my growth and the skills I learned, however I can see some 
            places where I could get better and I plan to continue working on those skills.        
        </p>


        <h3 class="small-header">Critical & Creative Thinking -  Depth & Breadth of Understanding</h3>

        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Goal:</strong> 
            My second goal for the winter co-op term is to deepen my knowledge of programming as a whole. This includes learning 
            more about the languages I'm programming in and learning more about how databases interact with the code I create.
        </p>
        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Action Plan:</strong> 
            Through working on my different tasks even so far, I'm trying to make sure I'm not just writing a solution and moving 
            on, but that I'm taking in the work and attempting to learn from each problem I face, taking note of what worked and 
            what did not, why something may or may not be a good solution.        
        </p>
        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Measure of Success:</strong> 
            Later on in the semester, I find that I'm already coming up with ideas on how to solve issues without researching why 
            something is going wrong, and if I remember and reuse solutions that I had found earlier in the semester I will consider 
            that good success.         
        </p>
        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Reflection:</strong> 
            I would say this goal has been a pretty good success for this term. As I said in my previous goal I had plenty of tasks 
            relating to code I was familiar with, and some that were completely different then what I was used to. Whenever I had code 
            that I was familiar with, including some repeats of code I first saw earlier in the semester, I was able to immediately 
            get started on ideas for how to accomplish the task. With some of the more challenging tasks for myself, I was able to get 
            guidance from my peers on the team, and I found being able to listen while following along in the code and being able to 
            vocalize my ideas really helped as I'm a verbal processor. Overall this semester taught me that while I have gained new 
            experience and knowledge about web development, I still have a lot of room to develop more skills and to learn new aspects 
            of developing a website.
        </p>



        <h3 class="small-header">Critical & Creative Thinking - Creativity</h3>

        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Goal:</strong> 
            Development takes a lot of creativity, that's why my last goal for the semester is to continue to challenge myself with being 
            creative in my work, coming up with interesting but easy to follow solutions to tasks.        
        </p>
        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Action Plan:</strong> 
            I plan to not only continue to grow my coding creativity through the different tasks I work on but also through different 
            events Tulip plans to host such as a hack day they host in July. I plan to participate in anything that will be a push to grow.
        </p>
        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Measure of Success:</strong> 
            By the end of the semester I would like to become better at what I outlined in my goal, and I believe a good measure of success 
            will come with seeing how much quicker I can come to a suitable solution to the issue I'm facing
        </p>
        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Reflection:</strong> 
            During the semester I participated in the Hack Day they hosted, and had the opportunity to develop my own solutions freely and 
            have them tested once completed and tested by myself. During their Hack Day I stepped out of my comfort zone and learned a new 
            web development technique of web scraping, building a simple webpage that successfully completed what I set out to do. Also I 
            got to try new aspects of web development, working on migrations and APIs, switching between server side and frontend development, 
            overall deepening my understanding of how one may build solutions to different challenges. One thing I am going to keep note of 
            though from this semester is in the future it would be helpful for me to write down my thoughts about how I plan to conquer a 
            challenge before I jump into the coding itself. There have been a few times where I would have great ideas, reach the end of the 
            day and when I came back the next day I would not exactly remember where I was going with an idea. Learning when to take notes 
            I believe will help me to become more productive and efficient when it comes to future positions.
        </p>


        <h1 id="job" class="body-header">Job Description</h1>

        <p class="textbox">
            My job included a good mix of work that involved backend and frontend development, sometimes together to complete tasks. Some of 
            my major deliverables included tasks relating to changes to the well.ca website such as changing their add to cart buttons, 
            troubleshooting issues that other new code added to their website such as duplicate bad links being created for some pages, and 
            making their site AODA complacent. Other minor tasks included smaller troubleshooting tasks, seeing if some issues that were 
            reported had been fixed already, and simple quick styling fixes to pages. 
        </p>

        <h3 class="body-header">New Skills</h3>
        <p class="textbox">
            All of these tasks had some aspect of it in PHP, which I spent some of my time studying their existing code and learning how to use 
            PHP in move backend development. I know my overall understanding of PHP and more of the server side interaction of it has grown. 
            Right along with this I learned how to better use SQL, manipulating the information in the tables and running database commands 
            from PHP code. Overall I feel I had the great opportunity to use languages and technologies I've used before to a higher level 
            of understanding.
        </p>


        <h1 id="conclusion" class="body-header">Conclusions</h1>

        <p class="textbox">
            Overall my experiences with Tulip Retail was a lot better than my previous work term. I felt that my knowledge on the languages and 
            overall problem solving skills were pushed and I had more opportunities to learn new aspects of the technologies I worked on. I now 
            have a better understanding of what working in a full developer team is like, how these teams plan and assign work, and the type of 
            tasks a full stack web developer would deal with. This term was a great step in my career, I am now looking to explore other options 
            outside web development to gain a larger field of experiences. That being said, I would not mind working in a position like this again.
        </p>

        <h1 id="acknow" class="body-header">Acknowledgements</h1>

        <p class="textbox">
            I want to thank my manager Eugene for the guidance while I was working this position, and Chris on the team for the assistance and 
            mentorship he offered. I would also like to thank the rest of the team for being so helpful, offering plenty of advice and opportunities 
            to grow.
