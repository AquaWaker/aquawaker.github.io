	<h1 class="body-header">Introduction</h1>

	<p class="textbox">
		This webpage is a collection of reflections and summaries of my first coop workterm with the University of Guelph on the Communications and Public Affairs Division as a Web Developer and Data Analyst over the Fall 2021 semester.  Presented is information pretaining to my employer, different learning goals I had, and summaries of what I worked on and skills I learned.
	</p>

	<h1 class="body-header">Employer Information</h1>

	<p class="textbox">
		This work term I had the pleasure to work with the University's Web Strategy Manager, James Harris, on the Communications and Public Affairs team where I spent my time working on various projects, designing and developing new webpages, or finding existing bugs and fixing them.  The team specialized in many other areas other then simply the University's webpage, contributing to different social media platforms, the team promotes the University to new future Guelph Gryphons, and keeps communication with current students about different campus activities, and encouragement during stressful times.
	</p>

	<h1 class="body-header">Learning Goals</h1>

	<h3 class="body-header">Communicating - Written Communication</h3>

	<p class="textbox">
		Goal: 	My first goal for the fall co-op term is to get better at my written communication. I have always found oral communication has come easier to me, written on the other hand I have had to work on. I want to get better at coming to my point, and be able to express the information I need to express in a clear, concise manner.
	</p>
	<p class="textbox">
		Action Plan: 	Considering the collaborative nature of working on a website to the scale of the University of Guelph's site, I will be working on plenty of small projects that will be used by others on the team. This will give me plenty of opportunities to communicate what I have completed or changed. I will use these opportunities to take extra effort to develop my written communications skills.
	</p>
	<p class="textbox">
		Measure of Success: 	I will consider success in developing my skills if I find by the end of the term I do not have to rephrase statements I make in communicating development changes and sharing my efforts in the different tasks I complete.
	</p>
	<p class="textbox">
		Reflection: 	
	</p>


	<h3 class="body-header">Professional & Ethical Behaviour - Teamwork</h3>

	<p class="textbox">
		Goal: 	My second goal of the work term is to develop better teamwork skills, specifically in how to collaborate on technical tasks. I have great experience from part time jobs that had plenty of opportunities to learn teamwork skills, but now I want to learn how to apply that to the computer science field since school so far has not had a collaborative technical assessment.
	</p>
	<p class="textbox">
		Action Plan: 	Like the first goal, the nature of the job on the website means I will not have to go out of my way to get into situations where communication and teamwork will be important for effectively completing tasks. I will take these situations with the mindset of wanting to develop my skills in teamwork and collaboration on projects.
	</p>
	<p class="textbox">
		Measure of Success: 	I will consider the situations I've been in where communication leads to better productivity and results as a measure of the success I've had.  It's hard to quantify the success of developing teamwork from self reflection so it will have to come from what I can defer from the others I work with.
	</p>
	<p class="textbox">
		Reflection: 	
	</p>


	
	<h3 class="body-header">Critical & Creative Thinking - Inquiry & Analysis</h3>

	<p class="textbox">
		Goal: 	Since my job title includes both development and also data analysis, I have a goal this semester to bridge the two and develop both skills through my ability to learn the information I need in a timely manner, and my analysis abilities for working on technical projects.
	</p>
	<p class="textbox">
		Action Plan: 	I've already had a few opportunities to improve my inquiry and analysis skills through varying tasks that I've had to complete research for or involved something I did not necessarily know how to accomplish.  I feel that I will continue to have more opportunities like this throughout this term that will allow me to learn more and grow in my skills.
	</p>
	<p class="textbox">
		Measure of Success: 	I will consider success in my growth of my inquiry and analysis abilities if I continue to be able to accomplish all the tasks assigned to me that require types of development I have to research first, and if I make useful notes of the information I'm given.
	</p>
	<p class="textbox">
		Reflection: 	
	</p>


	<h1 class="body-header">Job Description</h1>

	<p class="textbox">
		During this work term I had the opportunity to work on one main project with a few side activities and grow my current skills, as well as develope a few new ones on the job.  
	</p>
	<h3 class="body-header">Main Project</h3>
	<p class="textbox">
		My main project for the University's Communications team started with some research on other University Web Guide pages, determining strengths and flaws with each page, and taking note of the information delivered to the user.  From there I began an overhall of the University of Guelph's Web Guide and UI Kit pages.  I changed the layout and presentation of the UI Kit, adding new information, sample descriptions, separating different topics to new pages.  I even created some new functionality in the javascipt section of the webpage. After the Web Guide and UI Kit were where we wanted it, I took on the task of learning how to use WordPress and then the process of porting the progress on the git repository onto WordPress.
	</p>
	<h3 class="body-header">New Skills</h3>
	<p class="textbox">
		During school my web development focused more on the interaction between languages, and the handling of changing information to create a dynamic webpage.  During this work term I had the chance to learn a new language, PHP, as well as learn more about different aspects of web development and other web development tools such as Bootstrap and SCSS.  Working on the UI Kit sections in particular got me much more familiar with how to create a webpage that is both informative and well designed for the user, but also organised and easy to understand for others looking for simple tools for their pages.  Learning how to use WordPress was also a great experience, learning a new way to design and develope a web page that isn't directly in the code.
