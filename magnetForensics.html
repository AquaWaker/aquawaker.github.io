            This webpage is a collection of reflections and summaries of my fourth and final co-op work term that was with 
            Magnet Forensics as a Software Developer over the summer 2023 semester. Presented is information pertaining to 
            my employer, different learning goals I had, and summaries of what I worked on and skills I learned.

        <p class="textbox">
            This past summer I spent my last co-op term working for Magnet Forensics, specifically on their Review team. The 
            Review product is a web based application that allows forensics teams to dive deeper into information found on various 
            electronic devices collected through Magnet's other applications. Review is a product meant for collaboration so it 
            includes features for various users to share comments, and tag various pieces of evidence for future investigation.

        <h1 id="goals" class="body-header">Learning Goals</h1>

        <h3 class="small-header">Communicating - Written communication</h3>

        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Goal:</strong> 
            My first goal for this last co-op term is to continue working on developing my ability to share my thoughts and 
            ideas better through written communication as I feel this is one of my weak points.
        </p>
        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Action Plan:</strong>
            Between working with others on code testing, working on my own tickets where I need help, and doing QA work, I 
            will have plenty of opportunities to train myself in learning better ways to communicate ideas to people.
        </p>
        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Measure of Success:</strong>
            I want to be able to concisely share the information that the other person needs to know, as the work term 
            progresses I will use the opportunities given to me to keep working on my wording and if I see that I need to do 
            less calls to express my ideas and don't need to reword what I say as often I will call that a success.
        </p>
        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Reflection:</strong> 
            This semester was probably the most I've worked on projects with other team members directly, either working 
            together, through back and forth advice and guidance or through peer reviews. This led to many opportunities for 
            written communications between the various tasks. By the end of the semester I felt I had successfully learned a lot 
            of the workplace language and understood what I was working on well enough to concisely convey the information I 
            had to share when requesting help. I feel like a lot of the understanding I've been building up throughout the last 
            few coop jobs really came together on this last one and I didn't struggle with having to repeat myself.
        </p>


        <h3 class="small-header">Critical & Creative Thinking - Inquiry and Analysis</h3>

        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Goal:</strong>
            My second goal for this co-op term is to continue to grow in my ability to be able to study code written by others 
            and be able to glean what the code does and be able to ask relevant questions in hopes of deepening my understanding 
            of the product and other languages.
        </p>
        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Action Plan:</strong>
            By participating in code reviews and QA work, I get the chance to look into other people's code and test it. I want 
            to use this as an opportunity to challenge myself to be active in conversations about other people's work and learn 
            from what others are working on.
        </p>
        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Measure of Success:</strong>
            By the end of the semester I want to participate more and more in the code reviews, asking more insightful questions 
            rather than basic questions about the code and eventually maybe making suggestions and insights myself to help other 
            members of the team.
        </p>
        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Reflection:</strong>
            This was an interesting goal, because a little past midway through the semester I started feeling comfortable enough 
            with my knowledge of the product and the languages to start asking questions about other tickets, which was my goal. 
            However, once I started really participating we moved into a testing phase and then our attention was shifted to a 
            completely different part of the product so I had to build up some of the knowledge again in the last three weeks of 
            the work term. Overall I'm excited that I got to participate in some code reviews and debriefing of tickets and am 
            happy with the level of inquiry I got to.
        </p>


        <h3 class="small-header">Critical & Creative Thinking - Problem Solving</h3>

        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Goal:</strong>
            This being my last co-op work term and with technologies I haven't worked with yet, I feel like this is the perfect 
            opportunity to both show my progress and grow my abilities to adapt, learn, and solve issues in new languages.    
        </p>
        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Action Plan:</strong>
            This will be something that naturally happens throughout the semester but I have been taking greater care to push 
            myself to try things I'm unfamiliar with rather than constantly stick to what I know.

        </p>
        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Measure of Success:</strong>
            If by the end of the summer I have had the opportunity and successfully completed work in various languages and with new 
            technologies, where I feel I could go back and complete work with the same things and be able to work more efficiently, 
            I will feel that I have succeed in progressing my abilities to learn new ways to solve problems.
        </p>
        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Reflection:</strong>
            I almost exactly followed my measure of success section. I spent a good half of the year learning about many different 
            technologies, various languages they used, and different sections of the product. Then I began picking up tickets in 
            areas I had previously worked on and I could tell immediately working on them that they were going quicker due to my new 
            understanding. I was able to effectively solve new problems basing my understanding on previous tasks. 
        </p>


        <h1 id="job" class="body-header">Job Description</h1>

        <p class="textbox">
            Working with the tacos squad of the Review team, my main work consisted of backend development, fixing bugs and creating 
            unit testing for both new features I made and existing ones that required more. I worked on many different types of deliverables 
            during my time at Magnet Forensics. Some of which included fixing bugs created by new features such as making sure new variable 
            types were deleted when cases were deleted, creating new automatic testing that runs on the application each day to make 
            sure new bugs are not arising such as a unit test that runs the application and deletes evidence, then checks to see if the 
            evidence is really gone. I also had the opportunity to work on some of the new features that are still in progress now. I 
            even had the opportunity to work through QA testing of other team members' tasks, and be involved in various code reviews for 
            my own code as well as other people's.
        </p>

        <h3 class="body-header">New Skills</h3>
        <p class="textbox">
            This job gave me the opportunity to work in C# for the first time, and having done a lot of PHP and C work between school and 
            other jobs I felt very comfortable with it very quickly. I had a few issues with some of the classes included in libraries we 
            had but it made for a great teachable moment with one of my other coworkers to go through it. I also got plenty of learning 
            experience in various unit testing. There were multiple different portions of the code that required unit testing throughout my 
            time at Magnet, and I got lots of practice learning different ways of creating tests, even getting to use Cypress for some of them.
        </p>


        <h1 id="conclusion" class="body-header">Conclusions</h1>

        <p class="textbox">
            As my final co-op work term, I can confidently say that this was all I could have hoped for in a job experience. Working with a 
            great team of developers who were a well of knowledge to tap into, and developing on various differing areas of the product, I developed 
            strong technical and communication skills throughout this term. I am especially glad I got to work on so much unit testing because 
            I felt it was a skill I had not been able to work on enough between school projects and other jobs I have had so far. Now as I move 
            into my last year of school I feel confident with the skills I have developed and learned from all of my co-op jobs, and I am excited 
            to be able to begin my career.
        </p>

        <h1 id="acknow" class="body-header">Acknowledgements</h1>

        <p class="textbox">
            Even though the Review team was split into three squads, I got plenty of help from all of them during my time, but specifically got a lot 
            of help from everyone on the tacos squad. From Noah being available to help me with any questions I had, to Garrett giving me deeper dives 
            into the code. And there were plenty of other team members that helped me out too, so I'm thankful to all of them for helping me learn so 
            much during this work term.
