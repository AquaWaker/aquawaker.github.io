        <p class="textbox">
            This webpage is a collection of reflections and summaries of my third co-op work term that was with Tulip Retail 
            as a Backend Developer over the Winter 2023 semester. Presented is information pertaining to my employer, different 
            learning goals I had, and summaries of what I worked on and skills I learned.

        <p class="textbox">
            Over the winter I had the exciting opportunity to work with Tulip Retail for a second time, specifically with 
            their Checkout team. During my time there, I developed code for their Point of Sale application meant for sales 
            associates, creating new features, fixing various bugs, and working on the backend API. Point of Sale is only the 
            most recent of Tulip's endeavors of ecommerce products as they also assist companies with Clienteling.

        <h1 id="goals" class="body-header">Learning Goals</h1>

        <h3 class="small-header">Professional & Ethical Behaviour - Teamwork</h3>

        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Goal:</strong> 
            My first goal for this co-op term is to continue growing my ability to work as part of a team unit and build 
            up good communication skills for working through problems with people.

        </p>
        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Action Plan:</strong> 
            Through working on different bugs and features, I will challenge myself to learn how to bring up issues I'm 
            having and how to articulate where I'm at with tasks. This also includes working alongside non-developers on 
            issues that I need other's input for.
        </p>
        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Measure of Success:</strong> 
            If my tasks are completed in relatively good time and I don't struggle with explaining myself to people when I 
            need help with issues or need input I'll consider that a success
        </p>
        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Reflection:</strong> 
            Over the course of the semester I had many opportunities to communicate with my other team members over different 
            topics such as looking for advice on an issue, sharing how to test my changes in detail and getting information 
            from others about code related to what I was working on. This required both professional language for those I did 
            not quite know as well in the company as well as strong communication for teamwork related to collaborating on 
            tasks and I got to do exactly this. There was one particular task that I worked on that required me to work alongside 
            a non-developer on the team, as well as the front end dev to make a change. It took some teamwork to figure out how 
            I could make my backend changes line up with the front end's changes in such a way that solved the teams ask 
            fors on the task.    
        </p>


        <h3 class="small-header">Communicating - Written communication</h3>

        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Goal:</strong> 
            My second goal is tied very closely to the first one, which is growing my skills in communication. Specifically, 
            written communication about what I'm working on, and articulating my progress
        </p>
        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Action Plan:</strong> 
            Be specific and concise when messaging with others about the different tasks I'm working on. As well as being 
            informative when I put merge requests up with work I've done, explaining what I did.    
        </p>
        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Measure of Success:</strong> 
            If my conversations online go smoothly and I don't get a lot of clarifying questions as the semester goes on I'll 
            consider that a success in growing my written communication skills. 
        </p>
        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Reflection:</strong> 
            As I said before in the Teamwork reflection, there was plenty of opportunities to work on my written communication 
            skills and often that was the main communication channel for many questions, from me, or others about my tasks. Going 
            off of my measure of success specifically, I got a lot better at giving testing paths as the semester went on, making 
            sure that anyone that was going to test the changes could follow exactly what needed to be done and know what the 
            expected results should be. Overall, there was a clear improvement in my written communications as the semester went, 
            noticeably getting less clarification questions from others about my messages and code summaries which I consider 
            a great success. 
        </p>



        <h3 class="small-header">Critical & Creative Thinking - Problem Solving</h3>

        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Goal:</strong> 
            My third goal is a relatively simple one considering my field but I want to continue my skills in being about to problem 
            solve, and come up with solutions on my own or research based on what I know to find solutions      
        </p>
        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Action Plan:</strong> 
            This will come up with every issue I face during the work term, basically I want to be able come up with better solutions on 
            my own and when I can't, I want to grow my skills in knowing what questions to ask to get closer to the solution of my problem, 
            whether that be messaging someone with specific questions, or using Google for help.

        </p>
        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Measure of Success:</strong> 
            This comes down to how well I feel I complete the different tasks I'm given. So working hard to solve more difficult tasks as 
            the semester progresses, or being able to complete tasks related to things I'm not used to working with. I want to learn more 
            about technologies I'm not used to, and be more comfortable with the ones I have used.
        </p>
        <p class="textbox">
            <strong>Reflection:</strong> 
            This one is fairly simple compared to the last two, I feel like as the semester went on I was able to take on harder, more 
            impactful tasks. Needing less guidence to find where I needed to make my changes, and also was able to keep up with technical 
            discussion with other developers better. Definitely feel more comfortable with Javascript and PHP then I did before, and I 
            know a few more coding techniques!
        </p>


        <h1 id="job" class="body-header">Job Description</h1>

        <p class="textbox">
            My position on the checkout team involved mainly backend development, with a small handful of changes to the frontend to 
            complement backend changes. My various deliverables included tasks such as deprecating code that was no longer needed, bugs 
            involving inventory management such as items appearing in stores they should not appear in or items unable to be added to empty 
            lists, and working on error messages made from tax calculation errors that were being silenced. During my tasks I interacted 
            with other members of the team for some collaboration on changes, and lots of feedback on my various changes.
        </p>

        <h3 class="body-header">New Skills</h3>
        <p class="textbox">
            This is my third position that has been primarily PHP focused code, and even though I have worked with it a lot now, there were 
            plenty of new skills I learned. The main thing I feel stronger in is the interaction of various different PHP files passing 
            information and functions for use. One of the other specific topics I learned was some Regex in PHP. Also I worked in Javascript 
            for a few of the changes, reinforcing my core skills in the language. Overall I learned a great deal reading existing code and 
            adding new features around it.
        </p>


        <h1 id="conclusion" class="body-header">Conclusions</h1>

        <p class="textbox">
            Being the second time I've worked for a team at Tulip Retail, this work term allowed me to compare how various developer teams 
            operate. Being very close to the clients before, my last position we did not really have build phases where we focused on very 
            specific development paths as a team, but instead we worked task by task, working towards whatever the clients needed at the time. 
            Following the build phase driven development path with the Checkout Team was a great learning experience, we worked on features for 
            all clients, but also fixed issues affecting multiple companies signing on. I liked the drive to specific goals, working with other 
            team members on larger deliverables. All the experiences both in the development itself, and the team aspect of the job have been 
            valuable for my steps towards my career, and I'm excited for how it will help me moving onto my last co-op job before finishing school.
        </p>

        <h1 id="acknow" class="body-header">Acknowledgements</h1>

        <p class="textbox">
            The whole checkout team was super helpful to me, offering me plenty of advice and guidance throughout the work term. Specifically my 
            manager Mathieu, and my coworkers Dan and Michael. There were a lot of kind words from many other team members too, and I greatly 
            appreciate the experience I gained with the team.
